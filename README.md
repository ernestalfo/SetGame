# SetGame
My own implementation of the visual  perception card game Set Game, for Android. 

Set is a real-time card game designed by Marsha Falco in 1974 and published by Set Enterprises in 1991. The game envolved out of a coding system that the designer used in her job 
as a geneticist. Set won American Mensa's Mensa Select award in 1991 and placed 9th in the Deutscher Spiele Preis.

The first time I played Set game with physical cards, I thought I wanted to make a game to play this on a PC. I started that project in C++ in my college student years.
But this was never finished. After I graduated I had my first Android smartphone, and I remembered the Set game, this time I was excited about the Touch possibility and after 
the first versions, I added the possibility of competing with a friend each with their phone, establishing communication via Wifi, which was very exciting for me as well.

This was my first Android project, and I never saw another Android implementation for Set game while I was working on this. This one has some interesting features, 
such as the possibility of always being able to create at least one set of the 12 cards on the screen, which is not always possible when playing with physical cards.
I spread my apk to friends and coworkers, they gave me some valuable feedback and I enjoyed watching how many of them enjoyed playing the Set game on their phones.
